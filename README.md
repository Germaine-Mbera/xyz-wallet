# xyz-wallet
an onlineÂ platform that enables users to transfer and receive money

Python was used to create this e-wallet system. In order to design an electronic wallet that allows users to create accounts and send money, the author used classes and functions as an approach.

Senders who send less than $10,000 are not charged any costs; those who transfer between $10,000 and $100,000 are charged $200; those who send more than $100,000 are charged $1,000.

To authenticate and authorize any monetary transaction, the author also added a helpers file. This helped to prevent mistakes like sending money that was in excess of your balance.

Use the test.py file to test this system's functionality.
